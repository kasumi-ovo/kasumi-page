CollectionEntry is a generic type. Use it with the name of the collection you’re querying. For example, an entry in your blog collection would have the type CollectionEntry blog.

You can use vercel.json to override the default behavior of Vercel and to configure additional settings. For example, you may wish to attach headers to HTTP responses from your Deployments.

```js
export default function Test() {
    return (
        <div>What are you doing...</div>
    )
}
```
